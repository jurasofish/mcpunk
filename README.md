# MCPunk ðŸ¤–

MCPunk provides tools for [Roaming RAG](https://arcturus-labs.com/blog/2024/11/21/roaming-rag--make-_the-model_-find-the-answers/)
with [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol).

MCPunk is built with the following in mind
- **Chat is king** - 
- **Human in the loop always** -
- **Context must be carefully managed** - as context 

**Core functionality** allows your LLM to configure a project (e.g. a directory 
containing Python files). The files in this project are automatically "chunked". 
Each chunk is e.g. a Python function or a markdown section.
The LLM can then query the entire project for chunks with specific names or with
specific text in their contents. The LLM can then fetch the entire contents
of individual chunks.


**On top of this**, MCPunk provides tools for analysing git diffs to help
with PR reviews, and provides a task queue that LLMs can read and write, allowing
you to split work across multiple chats to keep context manageable.

All this with no SaaS, no pricing, nothing. Just you and Claude Desktop.
