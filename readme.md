# Commit Summariser

## What is this?

I don't know

## Okay, well, why does it exist?

Good question! I have a problem. I find LLMs to be great at understanding,
reviewing, and writing code so long as
1. It's relatively **straightforward** and follows **conventional patterns**
1. You have **proactively** provided them with all necessary **context** 

Problem 1 I don't think much can be done about.
Problem 2. Well, I can help with that. I would like to build a tool
that achieves the following
**Core Functionality**
1. I can select a set of diffs and have them summarised for consumption
   by an LLM. At the same time, I can select files which are not included
   in those diffs
1. When diffs/files are selected, the tool will suggest to me other
   files that I might like to include in the summary. Files that may be helpful
   for an LLM.
1. Is so easy to use that is turns into an extension of my own mind. This software
   will be built by me, for me, and possibly shared with others.
